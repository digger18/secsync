# Server API

#### createSnapshot

A callback that receives an object containing the `snapshot` structure sent by clients. The Snapshot should be persistet to a database. In case persisting fails an error should be thrown.

```ts
export type CreateSnapshotParams = {
  snapshot: SnapshotWithClientData;
};
```

#### createUpdate

A callback that receives an object containing the `update` structure sent by clients. The Update should be persistet to a database. In case persisting fails an error should be thrown.

```ts
export type CreateUpdateParams = {
  update: Update;
};
```

#### getDocument

A callback that should return the necessary document information. The simples implementation would just return the latest snapshot, the proofs for snapshot ancestor chain and all related updates.

A more advanced implementation should take into account if the full document or just a delta was requested and idenitfy if and if so which updates are necessary to send and only return those.

```ts
export type GetDocumentMode = "complete" | "delta";

export type GetDocumentParams = {
  documentId: string;
  knownSnapshotId?: string;
  knownSnapshotUpdateClocks?: SnapshotUpdateClocks;
  mode: GetDocumentMode;
};
```

Note: Depending on the application the `getDocument` can be a `getOrCreateDocument` and it creates a document if the ID has not seen before.

#### hasAccess

A callback to verify if the client has read or write access to the requested document. Should return `true` if the client has access and `false` in case not.

The callback is invoked with the following argument:

```tsx
type HasAccessParams =
  | {
      action: "read";
      documentId: string;
      websocketSessionKey: string | undefined;
    }
  | {
      action: "write-snapshot" | "write-update" | "send-ephemeral-message";
      documentId: string;
      publicKey: string;
      websocketSessionKey: string | undefined;
    };
```

#### hasBroadcastAccess

A callback to verify if clients are allowed to receive a new message. Should an array of `true` or `false` values matching the index of the `websocketSessionKeys` to indicate which client has access.

The callback is invoked with the following argument:

```ts
export type HasBroadcastAccessParams = {
  documentId: string;
  websocketSessionKeys: string[];
};
```

## additionalAuthenticationDataValidations

Must be identical to the supported `additionalAuthenticationDataValidations` on the client for data parsing to function correctly.

### Documentation Example Server

A fully functional server can be found here [https://github.com/serenity-kit/secsync/tree/main/examples/backend](https://github.com/serenity-kit/secsync/tree/main/examples/backend). Keep in mind that it accepts any client and does not verify the Websocket session key/token.

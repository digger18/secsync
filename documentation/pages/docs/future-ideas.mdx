## Visualize which user made which change

- In Automerge the user or device public should be used as an ID.
- In Yjs the clientID seems to be generated (TODO ask Kevin if it's possible to set it manually and the implications if two clients would have the same ID and edit offline)

### Possible Meta data issues

- Should users be able to identify which device of a user made a certain change?

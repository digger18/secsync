## Visualize which user made which change

- In Automerge the user or device public should be used as an ID.
- One idea was to leverage the clientID for it and assign it the publicKey. This approach would not work.
  - The main issue for the userId is that it's only a uin32 which results in only 4 bytes. The publicKey itself is way longer and also some randomness would be good in case users have multiple tabs open on the same web-device using the same publicKey. In the long run it's probably better to build a parallel structure allowing users to sign a transaction and make it verifyable instead of manipulating the `clientID` directly.
  - Note: For EphemeralMessages we already have validation. In the user state the publicKey is injected and verified within the `useYjsSync` hook. Details can be found here: https://github.com/serenity-kit/secsync/pull/47

### Possible Meta data issues

- Should users be able to identify which device of a user made a certain change?

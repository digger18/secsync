## Mode

Can be `"complete"` or `"delta"`. The default is `"complete"`

Providing `"complete"` informs the backend that the entire document should be loaded. This means the last known snapshot and all connected updates.

Setting it to `"delta"` means the only the necessary updates should be provided. This means only the necessary data is retrieved e.g.

1. Client is aware of the latest snapshot and three updates and only misses two updates then only two updates are sent.
2. Client is aware of an older snapshot, then the latest snapshot and all it's updates are sent.

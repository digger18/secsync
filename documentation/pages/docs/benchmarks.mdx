## Benchmarking ideas

What matters are three factors:

- How much time does it take to resolve the data on the server?
- How much time does it take to download the data?
- How much time does it take to decrypt and apply the data?

The focus should be on two scenarios:

- Mobile device
- Desktop

For the mobile device a 3 Mbit/s (average 3G connection) should be simulated and the processor throttled to match a medium Android device.
For the desktop device a 20 Mbit/s (slow cable connection) should be simulated.

There would be several test scenarios e.g.

- Load the Automerge paper recording of Martin Kleppmann https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types/tree/master/benchmark_data
- Load the blog post recording of Martin Kleppmann https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types/tree/master/benchmark_data
- Load 1 page document created by 1 client
- Load 10 page document created by 1 client
- Load 50 page document created by 1 client
- Load 1 page document created by 10 clients (two versions with and without simultaneous writes)
- Load 10 page document created by 10 clients (two versions with and without simultaneous writes)
- Load 50 page document created by 10 clients (two versions with and without simultaneous writes)
- Load 1 page document created by 100 clients (two versions with and without simultaneous writes)
- Load 10 page document created by 100 clients (two versions with and without simultaneous writes)
- Load 50 page document created by 100 clients (two versions with and without simultaneous writes)

A test would run multiple times and the median would be used for the result.

## Authorized Authors Example

This example demonstrates how to only allow a fixed set of authors. It leverages the `isValidClient` callback which will be invoked vor every update. In case all `snapshots`, `updates` and `ephemeralMessages` pass the `isValidClient` callback and `true` is returned all changes are accepted. In case `isValidClient` returns `false` or an error is thrown the change is rejected. Depending on the case it's simply ignored or the document ends up in a broken stage. More details can be found at [Error Handling](/docs/error-handling).

Example:

1. Select the first authorized author and add an item in the list
2. Open another tab and select the first non-authorized author and add an item in the list

The entry will not be synced to the first tab and in the `DevTool` box below you can see the errors. You can also refresh and see how the document is reconstructed (except the last update was a snapshot). In this case the previous snapshot could be loaded, but that case is not handled in this example.

NOTE: Choosing the same author in multiple clients will result in errors when trying to create update in parallel.

# Secsync

Is an architecture to relay end-to-end encrypted CRDTs over a central service.

It was created out of the need to have an end-to-end encrypted protocol to allow data synchronization/fetching incl. real-time updates to support [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) apps in combination with a web clients without locally stored data.
